        <p>I am a big fan of Harry Potter because the movies and novels both are so interesting,mysterious and adventurous. I love them. Harry Potter is a film series based on the eponymous novels by J. K. Rowling. The series is distributed by Warner Bros and consists of eight fantasy films, beginning with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and culminating with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â€“ Part 2. Harry Potter was born in Surrey, England, United Kingdom. His parents, Lily and James Potter, were killed by a evil wizard named Lord Voldemort, while Voldemort was trying to kill Harry. Yet Harry escaped with no harm except a scar in the shape of lightning bolt, and Voldemort ends up mostly dead.</p>
